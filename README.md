# Citi-Bike

I have been tasked with analyzing user behavior to help assess the current logistics model of bike distribution 
across the city and identify expansion opportunities.

# Objective

This project’s objective is to conduct a descriptive analysis of existing data and discover any actionable insights that New York Citi Bike can use to  help make informed decisions that will improve availability issues and ensure the company’s position as a leader in eco-friendly
transportation solutions in the city.

# Python Dashboard via Streamlit
**[Streamlit Dashboard](https://citi-bike-4cb3r2sgjde83xgwn2c8vn.streamlit.app/)**

# Key Questions
1. What are the most popular bike start stations across the city for Citi Bike rental and where are they?</br>
2. Are the existing stations evenly distributed over the city?</br>
3. What are the most common routes between stations?</br>
4. Which are the months with the most bike rides and which months have the least? Are seasons a factor?</br>
5. Is there a particular type ofi bike that is used or preferred over others?</br>

# Data
For this project I have sourced monthly data from New York Citi Bike for the year 2022, which totaled more than 30 million rows.
I also added weather data from New York using NOAA's API service.

# Tools
For this project I used Python, Visual Studio Code and the following libraries:

Pandas: for data analization</br>
Matplotlib: for data visualization</br>
Numpy: for mathematical equations</br>
plotly: for converting large numbers into readable strings</br>
streamlit: for data visualization</br>
keplergl: for visual exploration of large-scale geolocation data sets</br>
numerize: for converting large numbers into readable strings</br>
pillow: for image processing</br>

# Folders
The project files are broken down into the following folders:

01 Project Management - contains the project brief documentation detailing the analysis </br>
03 Scripts - contains the Jupyter notebooks containing the coding for the analysis and visualizations. </br>
04 Visualization - contains all of the graphs and graphics used when developing the final presentation with my insights. </br>
05_Dashboard - contains all of the files needed to run the Citi Bike dashboard on Streamlit.

# Sources
New York Citi Bike is a real company and their datasets are available via amazon Web Services. The weather data comes from an API from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration website, part of the US government.
